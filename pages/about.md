## About This Project

My client for this project, Rebecca Baumann, has an excellent and extensive collection of genre paperbacks about which they have compiled a wealth of information: they have noted the physical characteristics of each book, its content, and their own observations about it, including story beats, tropes, and whether the book is worth reading. This website is intended to become their very own personal digital database-slash-catalog, with items searchable by title, author, publisher, publication year, genre, and keyword.

Due to limitations imposed by circumstance, I have had to use books from my own personal library for this site as a demo. However, I have gone out of my way to ensure that I addressed all the fields that they mentioned they had in the spreadsheet are present in my own realization of it, to the best of my ability, in hopes that all the core functionalities are there, so the most that would be needed is to swap out one CSV for another. 

## Project Roadmap

So, where does this project go from here?

The most immediate step will be, when time and schedules allow, for me to get the data needed to convert my placeholder objects into the actual collection items for which this website has been created. 

I also intend to ask my client whether they wish to implement a more sophisticated showcase on the front page, or perhaps multiple, which display only books from a genre (horror, fantasy, sci-fi etc.). They may also desire to have an introductory video or webpage dedicated to their collection, in which case this "About" page will be repurposed, and a video potentially embedded somewhere within its confines. I do not anticipate any need or desire to create a method for inquiry by the public that is integrated into this webpage, as it makes everyone's job easier if that's contained to the usual channels that reference librarians prefer, but I could create submission forms on a separate page on the site if need be with the skills learned from this course.
